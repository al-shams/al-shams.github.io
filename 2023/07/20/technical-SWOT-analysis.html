                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>
                    In today’s rapidly evolving world of science and technology, the time between the emergence of a new
                    technology and its integration into various aspects of life—as well as the introduction of newer
                    technologies—has significantly shortened compared to the past. Technologies that emerged less than a
                    decade ago have become commonplace in our daily lives, and in some cases, are already being replaced
                    by the next generation of innovations. This document focuses on the fifth generation of
                    telecommunication networks (5G) and how they have evolved to meet new user demands, such as low
                    latency, high reliability, and enhanced security. We will examine the development process of these
                    networks and explore the emerging technologies within the telecommunications industry.

                    Among these new technologies, we will highlight those with the most significant impact on modern
                    telecommunication networks and prioritize them for discussion, analyzing their characteristics and
                    challenges. The document will categorize these technologies into two primary groups: those
                    integrated directly into telecommunication infrastructure networks and those designed for use in
                    access networks.

                    To investigate the development of fifth-generation telecommunications networks, we will examine the
                    efforts of various countries and companies operating in this field. Our analysis will focus on
                    leading countries in the telecommunications sector, neighboring Middle Eastern nations, top global
                    companies, and contractors operating within the Middle East. Throughout this investigation, we will
                    explore the challenges these entities face, their future plans, and the measures they are taking to
                    adapt to the evolving landscape of emerging technologies.

                    By gathering insights from these sources, we will make predictions and draw conclusions, with a
                    particular focus on the case of Iran. These forecasts will be based on available technical
                    information about global and Middle Eastern markets, while addressing current challenges and
                    proposing as many potential solutions as possible. It is important to note that, due to the
                    inherently speculative nature of future research and the rapid advancement of new technologies,
                    providing definitive solutions may not always be feasible. Nonetheless, this document aims to shed
                    light on the current state of telecommunications and the direction it may take in the future,
                    offering strategic insights to navigate the challenges ahead.
